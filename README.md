Minimal server script to stream readings from a broker.

### Usage

1. Create an env file with the required variables (names guessable from code).
2. Add the broker IP (username/password for auth if applicable).
3. Run `npm start` and visit http://localhost:3000 to see realtime sensor readings on the page.
4. Ensure page status says "Online" before debugging anything (include that in the report too).
